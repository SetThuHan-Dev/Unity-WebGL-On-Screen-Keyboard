# Unity-WebGL-On-Screen-Keyboard
In Unity 2022.1 or later which supports WebGL Inputfield enabling native mobile keyboard, after setting up as shown in Unity Doc, doesn't seem to work properly on Mobile Web Browser, such as Chrome and Apple WebKit in my test case. In asset store, you only need to pay less than $10 for native support.
